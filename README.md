## ðŸ“¦ Features Used
- Smoking Rate (%)
- Hospital Admissions (smoking-related)
- Pharmacotherapy Prescriptions

## ðŸ§  Model
A Linear Regression model was trained to predict mortality based on the above features.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Best RÂ² Score: `0.01`
- Mean Squared Error: ~3.9 billion

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Although the model had limited accuracy, this was a valuable exercise in:
- Real-world dataset merging
- Feature engineering
- Honest evaluation and reporting

## ðŸ”§ Tools
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
